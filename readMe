Just run app.py (and maybe go to index.html in templates if it doesnt show you the page)

For the YouTube link: Paste in any video's entire YouTube link (transcript or not)

PS: If no transcript, then the page will take longer to produce results.

For the API key: If you know the developer (me), then I can send you a free API key to use. If not, follow the following steps to get your own free one:

1. Create or Log in to Your Gemini Account
    If you donâ€™t have an account:
        Go to Gemini's website and click "Get Started".
        Complete the registration process by entering your email, creating a password, and verifying your identity if needed.
    If you already have an account:
        Log in with your email and password.
2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
    Navigate to "Account Settings" (usually accessible via your profile icon or menu).
    Find the 2FA Settings section and enable two-factor authentication for added security.
        You can typically use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy.
3. Access the API Key Management Section
    Once logged in, go to the "Account Settings" menu.
    Look for the "API" or "API Keys" section.
4. Create a New API Key
    Click the "Create API Key" button.
    Gemini may prompt you to confirm your password or authenticate with 2FA for security.
5. Set API Key Permissions
    Choose the permissions you want for the API key. Common options include:
        Read-only: For viewing account details and balances.
        Trading: To place and cancel orders.
        Withdrawals: (Not recommended unless necessary).
    For security, start with only the permissions you need.
6. Generate and Secure Your API Key
    Gemini will generate:
        API Key: A public identifier for accessing the API.
        API Secret: A private key used to authenticate requests.
    Important: Copy and save both the API key and secret securely. The secret is shown only once.
        Store them in a password manager or a secure file.
7. Test Your API Key
    Use Gemini's API documentation to test your new key with a simple request.
    Tools like Postman or programming languages like Python (using requests or Gemini API SDKs) can help verify functionality.
8. Monitor and Manage Your Keys
    Regularly review your API keys in the "API Management" section.
    Revoke unused keys and regenerate keys if you suspect a compromise.
Security Tips:
    Never share your API secret with anyone.
    Avoid enabling unnecessary permissions.
    Use IP address whitelisting if available to restrict access to your keys.
